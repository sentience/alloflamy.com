Beyond its distinctive interchangeable grip section, LAMY accent features a number of other unusual design elements for the brand, including its completely cylindrical body, a spring-loaded posting mechanism. Even the way the pen opens to expose its cartridge or converter is unique: the grip section (whichever one you choose) twists with the nib section and cap, but remains attached to the body even as the nib section unscrews smoothly away from it. Once the nib section is removed, the grip section can snap on and off the body.

accent was originally available in a slightly gold-tinted Palladium finish from 1998 through 2005, with a matte black finish available as a premium option with one or more exclusive grips during this same time frame. In 2015, accent was resurrected in a smooth aluminium finish and a new set of grip sections, both included and available separately. In 2019, this was joined by Brilliant Lacquer, a glossy black finish offered with a 14kt gold nib and, once again, exclusive premium grip sections.
