Predating the Lamy brand, the Artus 10P appears to be a relatively unfancy steel-nibbed, resin pen intended for everyday use, perhaps as a school pen.

Showing at least two distinct nib section designs (semi-hooded and “fingernail”) during its lifespan, this pen may be found in an unusual sky blue finish with chrome cap bands and clip appearing blank and with the Artus logomark.

Various posts online show this model was also available in black and red finishes, and there may have been others. If you have any more information to share about this model, please reach out!
